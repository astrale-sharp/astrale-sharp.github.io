I'm Astrale and I've been programming passionately for 10+ years. My journey started with Python and Linux but I since fell in love with Rust, Elm, and Godot and many more technologies.

I taught Physics and Chemistry in France for 4 years but I'm looking to find a new job in development. I'm interested in backend, frontend, video game development, ui, layout systems, technical challenges, Rust, and more.
